`pb-ui-registry` provides a visual gallery and a programmatic API for distributing reusable UI components. It is designed to work seamlessly with the `shadcn` CLI, allowing for instant installation of complex components, including a full suite of React Hook Form (RHF) integrated inputs.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Configure the registry

Add the `@pb-ui` registry to your `components.json`:

```json
{
  "registries": {
    "@pb-ui": "https://pb-ui-five.vercel.app/registry/{name}"
  }
}
```

### 2. Install components

Install any component directly into your project using the `shadcn` CLI:

```bash
# Example: Adding the Multi-Select component
npx shadcn@latest add @pb-ui/multi-select
```

> [!TIP]
> You can browse all available components and their interactive previews at [pb-ui-five.vercel.app/components](https://pb-ui-five.vercel.app/components).

## ✨ Key Features

- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Built from the ground up to leverage the latest CSS-only theming and performance improvements.
- **Base UI & RAC**: Uses `@base-ui/react` and `react-aria-components` for accessible, unstyled foundations.
- **RHF First-Class Support**: Includes a comprehensive set of "RHF Inputs" with pre-configured controllers for `react-hook-form` and `zod`.
- **CLI-Ready**: Fully compatible with the `shadcn` CLI for automated dependency management and installation.
- **Interactive Previews**: Every component in the registry includes multiple usage examples and live previews.
